                <p class="questInt">Why I like playing Chess?</p>
                <p>There is two reason why i like playing chess. Firstly, it can improve my logic and problem solving
                    skills. Secondly, it will bring enjoyable feeling when you can beat someone in chess.
                    I begun my journey in chess at the chess extracurricular in elementary school when I'm still 11
                    years old. For me, it wasn't an easy thing to become a great player in chess.
                    You need to have many practice to learn a pattern that can built your powerful tactics to fight
                    your opponent. I still remember when I always lose in every game of chess at my first year in chess
                    extracurricular.
                    Even thought that didn't make me surrender and run away from chess. All my loses make me curious to
                    keep practicing, hoping that I can beat someone in chess someday. All my effort has been paid back
                    when I manage to beat someone in chess at the next year. I manage to beat one of my friends in
                    extracurricular. It was a great experience when I could beat someone in chess for the first time.

                <p class="questInt">What is Chess basically?</p>
                <p>
                    Chess is a boardgame of strategic that was played on checkered board by two people. Each player
                    begin the game with 16 pieces that consists one King, one Queen, two bishop, two knight, two rook,
                    and eight pawns.
                    There are two kind of pieces in chess, the white pieces and the black pieces. The player who got the
                    white pieces always had the first turn to move in game. The goal of chess is to put
                    a direct attack to the opponent king from which escape is impossible.
                    This condition were known as checkmate. The picture below is the final position when I manage to do
                    a checkmate in chess. If you want to know more about chess rules you can check it by clicking this

                <p class="questInt">What is the interesting part of chess?</p>
                <p>
                    For me, the interesting part of chess is happening when I manage to make the opponent become
                    struggle or I who become struggle because of the
                    opponent tactics. Those two conditions force myself to think twice in make decisions. It because
                    every right decisions that had been made can bring a great advantage to checkmate opponent's king.
                    Of course there is a little gambling while I making my decision. For the conclusion, the part when
                    you must thinking twice is the most interesting moment while playing chess in my opinion.
