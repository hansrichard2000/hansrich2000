                In 2019 I joined Apple Foundation Program Batch 1. In that program I and my teammate developped a
                prototype app for gamers. It's name was Altrone. Altrone was an app to find game based on your play
                time.
                It also help you to set frequency and duration to get the best game recommendation which fit your play
                time.
                This app can be useful for gamer who had a limited time for playing.

                In the final assignment of Algorithm & Programming in the first semester at Informatics@UC, I and my
                patrner, Reiner Anggriawan Jasin, create a simple prototype program
                called as TebakSkuy. TebakSkuy was a game about funny riddle that also test your logic. The goal from
                this game was to bring you more joy and knowledge about funny riddle.
                This game was showed in My First App Exhibition at Universitas Ciputra.

                In 2019 I and my friends were contribute in making a website for UKM Task Force Sakura at Universitas
                Ciputra. We realised UKM Task Force Sakura need more media to publish
                their activity at society. Beside, they also need a media that can easily promote their activities and
                events to all students at Universitas Ciputra, so that many students
                will have interest in joining them. That thing made me and my friends at informatics create a website
                for them, so UKM Task Force Sakura can be more improved. There are many interesting features
                in this website you can check them all by clicking this link : <a

                In 2020 I make another website for Future Sablon Store. It was an online store that was founded by me and my sister 
                which sell custom T-Shirt and mask. This website was created during the beginning of the pandemic COVID-19. This website 
                was a solution to make an easy way to begin a bussiness during pandemic. In this website you can find any information about 
                the background and all product that was sold in Future Sablon Store. I hope this website can be usefull for Future Sablon Store. You can visit the website by clicking this link :

                In 2020 I and my friends were contribute in making an app during the pandemic COVID-19. This app called Students Assistant.
                Students Assistant is an app that can help student to remind their task and make notes for the college. 
                We realised sometimes Students forget about their assignment and sometimes have a dificcult to do notetaking. So we create this 
                app so that students like getting assistant to measure their assignment. <br><br>
                Do you always forget your task or homework? 
                Do you want to make your own notes for lesson with easily? Student Assistant can be your solution. 
                This App was created as your assistant to remind your task dan make a simple note for your activity. You can check Students Assitant demo in the video bellow.
